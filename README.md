# SQL-Project_Coal_CO2_LifeExpectancy
# SQL-Projects Coal Production and Consumption, Emission of CO2 and the length of the life expectancy.

# INTRODUCTION

I was asked to analyze data that contains the information of countries regarding Coal Production, Coal Consumption, CO2 Emission and Life Expectancy since 2000.
I am interested in details about this topic, so if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 
To analyze this data, I used Windows functions in SQL Server 

# ANALYSIS

The main task is to calculate which countries produce and consume the greatest and smallest amount of coal and which ones emitted the largest and smallest amount of CO2. 
Then, the length of the life expectancy was also analyzed.
Furthermore, an in-depth analysis was performed such as the statistical description, the cumulative distribution and the percentile rank, the classification of the countries by three groups based on the production, consumption of coal, emission of CO2 and the length of the life expectancy.
The running total and the year over year percentage growth of coal production, coal consumption and CO2 emission were also calculated. 
The analysis of the continents was also conducted.
Last but not least, I would like to verify if the production and the consumption of coal and the emission of CO2 affect the life expectancy in these countries. 
Then, I would like to analyze if there is any correlation between these ones.
The whole steps of my analysis were described in my project.

# THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS

## The production of coal
1.	China produced the largest amount of coal between 2000 and 2019. The highest level of coal production (22171TWh) was found in 2019. Whereas Bhutan produced the smallest amount of coal in 2016, but interestingly Venezuela produced the smallest amount of coal in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The smallest level of coal production (1 TWh) was found in 2007 from Bhutan.  
2.	TOP10 countries which produced the largest amount of coal between 2000 and 2019 are China, United Stated, Australia, India, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Poland, Germany and Kazakhstan. 
3.	China, Indonesia, United Stated, Australia, India, Russia and South Africa produced greater amount of coal than the average production of coal by countries in 2019
4.	Asia and Oceania produced the largest amount of Coal between 2000 and 2019

## The consumption of coal
1.	China consumed the largest amount of Coal (22915 TWh) between 2000 and 2020. Whereas they are few countries, which consumed the smallest amount of coal (1 TWh) in this period of time.
2.	It was found that China, India, United States, Japan, South Africa, Russia, Indonesia and South Korea consumed the amount of coal greater than the average consumption of coal by countries in 2020.  
3.	NON-OECD countries consumed the largest amount of coal between 2000 and 2020

## The emission of CO2
1.	China emitted the highest amount of CO2 (13069.98 MT), whereas Saint Helena emitted the lowest amount of CO2 0.01 (MT) between 2000 and 2017
2.	China, United States, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Spain, Taiwan, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ukraine, Argentina, Vietnam, Pakistan, Iraq and Netherlands were found that they emitted the level of CO2 greater than average level of the emission of CO2 by countries in 2017
3.	China, United States, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, Iran, South Korea, United Kingdom belong to countries which emitted the largest amount of CO2 between 2000 and 2017.
4.	Asia and Pacific emitted the greatest amount of CO2 between 2000 and 2017.

## The life expectancy
1.	The highest average life expectancy belongs to Monaco, San Marino, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy Macao, Switzerland, Andorra, Australia, Cayman Islands between 2000 and 2019
2.	Monaco has the greatest life expectancy, while Central African Republic has the lowest life expectancy.
3.	Northern America was found that it has the highest life expectancy.

## All in all,
1.	There is no correlation between emission of CO2 and the length of life expectancy for countries between 2000 and 2017
2.	There are a few countries, which do not have enough coal for their usage.
